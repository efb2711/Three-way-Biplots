\arguments{
\item{X}{A data matrix}

\item{C}{Component matrix of the third mode}

\item{B2}{Covariates matrix}

\item{namesA}{Optional vector of row names for `A`. If not provided,
default names are generated.}

\item{namesBC}{Optional vector of column names for the Kronecker product of
`B` and `C`. If not provided, default names are generated based on `J` and
`K` dimensions.}

\item{namesB2}{Optional vector of row names for `B2`. If not provided,
default names are generated.}
}
\value{
A list with class `ContinuousBiplot`
}
\description{
Generates a triplot based on a three-dimensional array `Y3D`, a data
matrix X and their decomposition.
