\title{Interactive Biplot}
\usage{
InteractiveBiplot(Y3D, A, B, C, G = NULL, namesA = NULL, namesBC = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y3D}{The unfolding of the first mode of the three-way data array.}

\item{A}{Component matrix of the first mode}

\item{B}{Component matrix of the second mode}

\item{C}{Component matrix of the third mode}

\item{G}{The unfolding of the first mode of the core matrix (only for
Tucker3 decomposition)}

\item{namesA}{Optional vector of row names for `A`. If not provided,
default names are generated.}

\item{namesBC}{Optional vector of column names for the Kronecker product of
`B` and `C`. If not provided, default names are generated based on `J` and
`K` dimensions.}
}
\value{
A list with class `ContinuousBiplot`
}
\description{
Generates an interactive biplot based on a three-dimensional array `Y3D` and
its Tucker3 or PARAFAC decomposition.
}

# Example of function usage:
data(X3way)
Y3D <- X3way
data(ResultsTucker3)
namesA = c("i1","i2","i3","i4","i5","i6","i7","i8")
Biplot <- InteractiveBiplot(Y3D = Y3D, A = A, B = B, C = C, G = G,
namesA = namesA)
colores <- c("red", "blue", "dark green", "purple", "orange", "pink","brown")
vector_colores <- rep(colores, 7)
plot(Biplot,ColorVar = vector_colores,mode="ah",ColorInd = "black")
